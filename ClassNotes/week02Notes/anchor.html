    <h1>Shanna's poety</h1>
    <p>
        Poetry doesn’t just reflect life—it makes life an object of art. Whatever state or mood you’re in, poems about
        life are there to guide you, to ease <a href="#" class="first-link"> you and to help you find meaning and make
            sense of the world around you.</a>Whether you’re toasting a recent achievement with words of congratulations
        or celebrating your soul mate with love poems, poetry is there to accentuate your feelings of joy and to word
        them beautifully.

        It’s there, too, when life is less than rosy: when you’re feeling down, suffering from heartbreak or full of
        confusion.</p>

        Even when you’re dealing with an agonizing loss, funeral poems are a comfort. <a href="#"
            class="second-link"> Moral of the story: <a href="#'/a> Poetry sheds light on our lives, no matter the occasion, and it’d be a
        shame not to enjoy its wonders./a>
