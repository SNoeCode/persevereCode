            <p>Immersed in the digital landscape, you come across the guiding principles known as the Code of Ethics
            governing the Ephemeral Circuits. These principles promise a harmonious coexistence within the virtural
            realm. Although, a sense of rebellion against the established norms of the Ephemeral Circuits stirs within
            you. You question the rigidity of the Code of Ethics and consider the potential benefits of a more fluid set of guidelines. DO YOU.....</p>
